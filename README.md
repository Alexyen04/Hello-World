# Hello World

My first game built. 

How to play:
Use W,A,S,D as movement keys for the game.
W=Up A=Left S=Down D=Right

The goal of the game is to reach the end portal at the top of the map. You will use movement keys to try and dodge the moving enemies across the board. After you will try to cross the river by riding the logs. Once you reach the end portal you win!
